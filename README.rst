# whisper-write

Video demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnFtVR72jM4&feature=youtu.be

Simulate keyboard typing with voice commands on your computer. Use the power of OpenAI's Whisper.

Start the wkey listener. Keep a button pressed (by default: right ctrl) and speak. Your voice will be recoded locally. When the button is released, your command will be transcribed via Whisper and the text will be streamed to your keyboard.

You can use your voice to write anywhere. 
Now with support for whsiper.cpp to locally transcribe your voice.

If you use Whisper API, you will incur costs. Currently, it costs $0.36 for 1 hour of transcription.

## Setup

Install the package.

```shell
pip install -e .
```

You will need to set two environment variables:

- OPENAI_API_KEY: your personal OpenAI API key. You can get it by signing up here: https://platform.openai.com/
- WKEY: the keyboard key you want to use to start recording. By default, it is set to right ctrl. You can use any key. Note that Mac and Windows might have different key codes. You can run `fkey` (post installing the repo) to find the code of the key you want to use.

You can set the environment variables in your shell:

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>
export WKEY=ctrl_r
```

Run `wkey` in a terminal window to start listening. 

If there are issues, check the additional requirements.

## Additional requirements

Requirements differ depending on your OS.

### Ubuntu

You will need to install the portaudio library. 

```shell
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev 
```

### Mac
You will need to authorize your terminal to use the microphone and keyboard. Go to System Settings > Privacy and Security. Then: 
* Select Microphone and authorize your terminal.
* Select Accessibility and authorize your terminal.

Restart the terminal for the changes to take effect. 

Note that this might entail security risks.

### Windows
Haven't tested it on Windows yet. If you do, please let me know how it goes.

## Security risks

This script creates a recording with your microphone and sends the audio to the Whisper API. The Whisper API response will be automatically streamed to your keyboard and executed there. This might entail security risks. Use at your own risk.
